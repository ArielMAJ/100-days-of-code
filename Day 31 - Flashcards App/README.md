# Day 31 - Flashcards App

### How it works:

You can flip cards by clicking on the card or pressing space bar. If you don't flip manually, it will automatically flip to the back of the card after 3 seconds.

- If you remember what's on the back, you can either press "1" or click on the green button;
- If you don't remember what's on the back, you can either press "2" or click on the red button;
- The program keeps track of correct and total count of studied cards. It shows the smaller correct counts first and then the smaller studied count.

To stop reviewing, simply close the app.


### To keep in mind:

- This miniproject follows black and pylint;
- Make sure to install the requirements: this project uses customtkinter instead of tkinter.

### Etc:

custom_card.py was an attempt of making a customtkinter frame with a shadow. I ended up choosing to use the png image provided by the assignment.
