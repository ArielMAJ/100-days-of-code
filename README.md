# 100 Days of Code:  The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022

My solutions/projects in the 100 days of code challenge course. 

Keep in mind it's 100 projects for 100 days, nobody said those needed to be consecutive days (...i think). 
So, as almost every new project gets more complex than the last one, I'm taking my time and completing them when I feel it's a good day to tackle it.

Of course I liked the idea of coding everyday anyway (and I am), so check out my other repositories to see what else I'm working on.

## Days 01~14: Beginner projects (to be uploaded)

These were all written in a Jupyter Notebook. They are very simple "projects" just to go through the very basics of Python.

## Days 15~31: Intermediate projects

These go through a few more complex python concepts, different libraries/modules.
Tkinter is explored a lot here and the student is highly encouraged to search up stuff on his own to complete the projects.


The projects I'm the most proud of in this group are the:

I didn't diverge too much from the proposed by the teacher, but it ended looking quite nice. 
I personalized the buttons and added the functionality of pausing the timer (which isn't proposed by the teacher).

This is my favorite one from the intermediate projects. I was studying SQLite when I did this project and decided to use it to store the passwords.
I ended up going overboard and added a second window in which the user can easily see all passwords/search for specific ones/delete them/copy them to the clipboard.
The original project stores them in txt files and you have to open the file manually to see them. 
Later on "Day 30" the teacher proposes using JSON files to store them and proposes a simple search button, but what I had already done was far better.

From this project onward I started incorporating a little bit of the knowledge I acquired from CS50P: black and pylint was extensively used and followed, etc. I also changed from tkinter to customtkinter.
